                    <p>
                        In mid-November, I found a job post I wanted to apply for, but I didn‚Äôt have many case
                        studies
                        that I can present. At that time, I was already busy creating a portfolio website using
                        coding
                        so I didn‚Äôt have enough time for a new project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, a lightbulb moment! The Sprint book on my bookshelf caught my eye. I was hooked!
                        Five days
                        to create a case study?! <span>Challenge accepted! Five days later, I created a new Learning
                            English page for the Cambridge University Press & Assessment.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout this project, I discovered that, for a user-centred design, it's crucial to
                        comprehend not just the users' needs but also their behaviours. User testing revealed
                        that my
                        initial hypothesis about user behaviour in selecting a learning resource didn't align
                        with
                        reality. This prompted me to enhance my design to better cater to their needs and
                        behaviours.

                        Have you ever visited the Cambridge University Press & Assessment for learning English?
                    </h2>
                    <p>Unfortunately, this was my first time visiting the website, and I wasn't aware that they offered
                        free learning resources. If I had known, I could have utilised these resources when I was
                        studying for the IELTS! While browsing the website, I identified areas that could be improved
                        for a better user experience.</p>

                    <p>
                        My challenge was to create a new Learning English page. The website offers various learning
                        resources for learners, teachers, and organisations for free, which is excellent. However, the
                        resources are currently organised in a somewhat random order, making it difficult to find
                        specific ones. My goal is to ensure that the page is user-friendly, allowing learners to
                        effortlessly discover resources that match their learning objectives. Additionally, I aim to
                        help users stay motivated so they can continue improving their English skills.

                        want to learn or use, it is difficult for them to make progress.

                <p>‚ú® Here's how I ran the solo-sprint, where I diverged from the Sprint book, what worked well,
                    and
                    where I went astray.

                    Before I started the design sprint, I had a quick research about the organisation and
                    conducted a
                    user survey so I can have clear goals and objectives for the design sprint.

                    <p>Analysing the data from the user survey and conducting in-depth research about the
                        organisation
                        helped me define the problem and set a clear goal for the project. As it was my first day of
                        the
                        design sprint, I wasn't 100% sure whether I was on the right track. However, I used the book
                        as a
                        guide and completed the tasks one by one.

                        applicability to our website, and followed a four-step sketching process (Gather information ‚Üí

                        careful consideration, created storyboards for two. While in a typical sprint, one might choose
                        the best idea for a storyboard, in this solo sprint, my goal was to generate and narrow down as
                        many ideas as possible.

                    <p>In the morning, I conducted a thorough review of the storyboards, critiquing each idea to
                        assess
                        strengths, areas for improvement, and elements that weren't working. Once I selected the
                        concept, I
                        expanded the storyboard to create a more comprehensive user journey, laying the groundwork
                        for
                        tomorrow's task of developing a prototype.
                        <span>
                            Given the solo nature of the sprint, decision-making was expedited since there weren't
                            extensive
                            discussions or multiple ideas to consider. To compensate for the absence of team members, I
                            simulated discussions by engaging with Chat GPT as if they were colleagues. This exercise
                            not only
                            allowed for constructive criticism but also led to the discovery of valuable ideas.
                            Critiquing and
                            developing ideas through this process was enlightening, and I look forward to future
                            discussions
                            with real people in my next project.</span>

                        mimicking the structure of the current website. My coding skills enabled me to precisely

                    <p>I conducted user testing with 5 participants. My goal for user testing was to see whether the
                        website
                        is easy to navigate and whether users find a advanced filter useful (is it helpful to find the

                        Unfortunately, my hypothesis regarding user behaviour when choosing a learning resource did
                        not
                        align with their actual behaviour.

                        From the research stage, I discovered that people have various reasons to learn English and
                        these
                        motivations are not improving their grammar or listening skills. The reasons behind is that
                        they
                        want to have a new foreigner friend, want to know about their favourite movies and for their
                        career.
                        Their ultimate goal for learning English is not certainly improving a listening skill.

                        To address this, I aimed to add the interest in filters so users could learn to achieve
                        their
                        learning goals. However, users didn‚Äôt think about their ultimate goals when they try to
                        choose a
                        learning resource.

                        design thinking process and how to apply it to complex problems. Every technique in the design
                        sprint proved beneficial, and one of my favourites is the 4-step design sketch. This method
                        helped me to swiftly visualise ideas, facilitating the identification of improvements and
                        errors in the process.</p>

                    <p><b>Collaborative Problem-Solving:</b> The importance of collaboration became evident
                        during moments of creative block. Whenever I faced with challenges or a mental roadblock, I had
                        a brainstorming session with my husband. This collaborative
                        effort not only sparked new ideas but also served as a constructive means to identify
                        improvements and detect errors. The power of collaboration, especially in overcoming mental
                        hurdles, was a significant revelation during this case study.</p>

                        prefer offline courses to online courses/activities. The reasons are that they want to interact
                        with people to be motivated and get instant feedback. I would love to tackle this problem: "How
                        might we make online resources more interactive so users enjoy learning online?" </p>
