                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <p>After understanding users' needs through user research, I created a user persona and a user
                        journey.
                        After creating a lo-fi prototype, I ran user testing with 6 potential users. While the
                        prototype
                        functioned as intended, it did not provide a solution aligned with what the users truly
                        needed.
                        This
                        prompted me to reassess users' challenges and explore a new solution.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <h2>User Research</h2>
                    <p>I analysed 3 health related apps to learn about the current market and conducted a user
                        survey
                        and
                        interviews to validate my hypothesis and understand users' insights.

                        To organise users' insights, I have created an affinity map and categorised them into 3 main
                        points
                    </p>

                        to do in their lives. </p>

                        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                        <p>There's a market gap for health apps that seamlessly fit into users' daily routines
                            with
                            achievable activities. Also, there are not many developed office workout apps.
                        </p>
                        <p>Users don't like to workout regularly. They prefer quick lunchtime walks and
                            spending
                            time
                            with friends and family.
                        </p>
                        <p>They want an easy-to-use and useful health app. It shouldn't ask users to spare much
                            time.
                        </p>
                        <p>According to the user survey, the most desired feature is a recommended health
                            activity
                            and
                            guide (67%). Tracking and recording health are the second most desired features.
                            Users
                            are
                            looking for features like progress tracking and reminders to help them stay
                            motivated.

                    <h2>User Persona & Journey</h2>
                    <p>From the user research, I integrated feedback into user personas. For example, one of our
                        personas, Mandy is frustrated about her health management. She has attempted to create plans
                        for
                        going to the gym and eating healthily, but she finds it challenging to take action or
                        exercise
                        regularly.</p>

                    </picture>
                    <p>I also created a user journey to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and
                        expectations
                        that users may encounter throughout their experience. </p>

                    <h2>Skeches</h2>
                    <p>I sketched my ideas. Then I moves to mockups, and finally to the high-fidelity prototype.
                        During
                        the sketch phase, I use Crazy 8 to explore diverse design ideas.</p>

                    <p>I then brought my idea to an interactive digital low-fidelity prototype and realised the need
                        for
                        usability testing to iterate features.</p>

                    <h2>Usability Test</h2>
                    <p>I conducted user testing with six potential users. During engaging with potential users, I
                        found
                        that I need to reassess users' challenges and explore a new solution. </p>

                        health details is not what they need. They are looking for something that can help them stay
                        motivated and improve their health with minimal effort.</p>

                    <p>I revisited users' feedback and created a new problem statement.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <h2>Major Design Iterations</h2>
                    <p>I made three major modifications based on the users' feedback and a new problem statement. I
                        took
                        note of the user comments and suggestions and worked hard to implement them in order to
                        solve
                        users' real problems. </p>
                    <img src="img/olive/iteration.png" alt="iteration-img">
                    <h3>Iteration 1. who is recording their steps manually?</h3>
                    <p>Who is recording their steps manually? Indeed! In the initial version of the app, I designed
                        it with intention of allowing users to track their unique health needs in one app. Through
                        usability testing, I learnt that my approach was flawed. I revaluated users' feedback and
                        found a new problem.

                        Based on that, **I redesigned the app to help users incorporate exercise seamlessly into
                        their busy schedules. Now, the app provides personalised health plans that match their
                        routines, making it much simpler and more practical for users.**</p>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Iteration 2. Don't make users more work</h3>
                    <p>During usability testing, all six participants found it challenging to navigate to the next
                        page when there were multiple features displayed on the screen. Therefore, to improve
                        usability, I simplified the recording process, enabling users to effortlessly log their
                        workout data with a single button click instead of recording manually through the adding
                        button. </p>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Iteration 3. The goal is not measureable</h3>
                    <p>The original concept allowed users to create their own affirmations to remember their goals,
                        but they struggled to measure their progress. To address this, I replaced the concept of
                        goals with level-based features. This enables users to easily track their health improvement
                        and feel a sense of achievement as they level up.</p>

                <h2>What I Learnt</h2>
                <p>Understand the design process: In my first UX/UI design project, I had the opportunity to
                    learn a lot. Olive helped me understand the design process, enhanced my communication skills
                    through user interviews and usability testing, and become familiar with Figma.</p>
                </br>
                <p>Importance of user testing: As mentioned earlier, I found it necessary to make significant
                    design changes following usability testing. Initially, this was quite surprising and even
                    unsettling. However, I came to realise that this is a fundamental part of the user-centred
                    design process. Ultimately, this process led to the creation of an app that better addresses
                    users' real needs. It taught me the importance of iterating and refining designs based on
                    users' feedback.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p>Another usability test: I am excited about conducting another usability test to validate
                    whether my new design meets users' needs and is achievable. This presents another
                    opportunity to enhance my usability testing skills. In the past, I learnt on the job and
                    took longer than I expected. This time, I aim to be more prepared and thorough in my
                    approach.</p>
                </br>
                <p>Desktop version: I want to further develop a desktop version of Olive so users in the office
                    can use the app efficiently. </p>
