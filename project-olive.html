                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>After understanding users' needs through user research, I created a user persona and a user
                    journey.
                    After creating a lo-fi prototype, I ran user testing with 6 potential users. While the
                    prototype
                    functioned as intended, it did not provide a solution aligned with what the users truly
                    needed.
                    This
                    prompted me to reassess users' challenges and explore a new solution.</p>
                <img src="img/olive/design-process-olive.png" alt="design-process">

            <div class="row">
                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>I analysed 3 health related apps to learn about the current market and conducted a user
                    survey
                    and
                    interviews to validate my hypothesis and understand users' insights.

                    To organise users' insights, I have created an affinity map and categorised them into 3 main
                    points
                </p>
                <img src="img/olive/affinity-map-olive.png" alt="affinity-map">
                <p style="font-style: italic;">Insight: Users don’t want to spare time for workouts as they are busy and
                    there are more fun
                    things
                    to do in their lives. </p>
                <div class="row">
                    <h3 style="padding-top: 30px;">✨ Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>There's a market gap for health apps that seamlessly fit into users' daily routines
                        with
                        achievable activities. Also, there are not many developed office workout apps.
                    </p>
                    <p>Users don't like to workout regularly. They prefer quick lunchtime walks and
                        spending
                        time
                        with friends and family.
                    </p>
                    <p>They want an easy-to-use and useful health app. It shouldn't ask users to spare much
                        time.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to the user survey, the most desired feature is a recommended health
                        activity
                        and
                        guide (67%). Tracking and recording health are the second most desired features.
                        Users
                        are
                        looking for features like progress tracking and reminders to help them stay
                        motivated.

            <div class="row">
                <h2>User Persona & Journey</h2>
                <p>From the user research, I integrated feedback into user personas. For example, one of our
                    personas, Mandy is frustrated about her health management. She has attempted to create plans
                    for
                    going to the gym and eating healthily, but she finds it challenging to take action or
                    exercise
                    regularly.</p>
                <img src="img/olive/persona-olive.png" alt="persona">
                <p>I also created a user journey to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and
                    expectations
                    that users may encounter throughout their experience. </p>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>Sketches</h2>
                <p>I sketched my ideas. Then I moved to mockups, and finally to the high-fidelity prototype.
                    During
                    the sketch phase, I used Crazy8 to explore diverse design ideas.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>Wireframes & Prototypes</h2>
                <p>I then brought my idea to an interactive digital low-fidelity prototype and realised the need
                    for
                    usability testing to iterate features.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>Usability Test</h2>
                <p>I conducted user testing with six potential users. While engaging with potential users, I
                    found
                    that I need to reassess users' challenges and explore a new solution. </p>

                <p style="font-style: italic;">Insights: Users don't want to manage all aspects of their health.
                    Recording all their unique
                    health details is not what they need. They are looking for something that can help them stay
                    motivated and improve their health with minimal effort.</p>

                <p>I revisited users' feedback and created a new problem statement.</p>

                    <img src="img/olive/iteration.png" alt="iteration-img">
                    <h3>Iteration 1. Increased User Experience by aligining the app's concept with users' real needs
                    </h3>
                    <p>I modified the concept of the app to align with users' goals and behaviour. The revised concept
                        transforms the app into a platform that enables people who are too busy to work out to
                        effortlessly take care of their health in their daily lives.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Iteration 2. Enhanced usability by simplifing the recording process</h3>
                    <p>During usability testing, all six participants found it challenging to navigate to the next
                        page when there were multiple features displayed on the screen. Therefore, to improve
                        usability, I simplified the recording process, enabling users to effortlessly log their
                        workout data with a single button click instead of recording manually through the adding
                        button. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Iteration 3. Incorporated a level-based feature to enhance user engagement in the app's user experience</h3>
                    <p>The original concept allowed users to create their own affirmations to remember their goals,
                        but they struggled to measure their progress. To address this, I replaced the concept of
                        goals with level-based features. This enables users to easily track their health improvement
                        and feel a sense of achievement as they level up.</p>

                <h2>What I Learnt 🌱</h2>
                <p><b>Understand the design process:</b> In my first UX/UI design project, I had the
                    opportunity to learn a lot. Olive helped me understand the design process, enhanced my communication
                    skills through user interviews and usability testing, and become familiar with Figma.</p>

                <p><b>Importance of user testing:</b> As mentioned earlier, I found it necessary to make significant
                    design changes following usability testing. Initially, this was quite surprising and even
                    unsettling. However, I came to realise that this is a fundamental part of the user-centred
                    design process. Ultimately, this process led to the creation of an app that better addresses
                    users' real needs. It taught me the importance of iterating and refining designs based on
                    users' feedback.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <h2>Next Steps ⏭️</h2>
                <p><b>Another usability test:</b> I am excited about conducting another usability test to validate
                    whether my new design meets users' needs and is achievable. This presents another
                    opportunity to enhance my usability testing skills. In the past, I learnt on the job and
                    took longer than I expected. This time, I aim to be more prepared and thorough in my
                    approach.</p>
                <p><b>Desktop version:</b> I want to further develop a desktop version of Olive so users in the office
                    can use the app efficiently. </p>
