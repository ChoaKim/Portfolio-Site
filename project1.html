                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>People now value their health more after COVID-19. However, busy schedules and low motivation make it
                    hard to stay healthy.</p>
                <p>“A study by the World Cancer Research Fund found that lack of motivation (38%) and feeling tired
                    (35%) are the main reasons UK adults struggle to improve their diet and be more active.”</p>
                <p>How might we help users incorporate regular exercise habits into their busy daily routines?
                    How might we help users stay motivated in their health routine?

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <p>After understanding users' needs through user research, I created a user persona and a user journey.
                    After creating a lo-fi prototype, I ran user testing with 6 potential users. While the prototype
                    functioned as intended, it did not provide a solution aligned with what the users truly needed. This
                    prompted me to reassess users' challenges and explore a new solution.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>I analysed 3 health related apps to learn about the current market and conducted a user survey and
                    interviews to validate my hypothesis and understand users' insights.

                    To organise users' insights, I have created an affinity map and categorised them into 3 main points
                </p>

                </picture>
                <p>Insight: Users don’t want to spare time for workouts as they are busy and there are more fun things
                    to do in their lives. </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ui>
                        <li>There's a market gap for health apps that seamlessly fit into users' daily routines with
                            achievable activities. Also, there are not many developed office workout apps. </li>
                        <li>Users don't like to workout regularly. They prefer quick lunchtime walks and spending time
                            with friends and family.</li>
                        <li>They want an easy-to-use and useful health app. It shouldn't ask users to spare much time.
                        </li>
                        <li>According to the user survey, the most desired feature is a recommended health activity and
                            guide (67%). Tracking and recording health are the second most desired features. Users are
                            looking for features like progress tracking and reminders to help them stay motivated.</li>
                    </ui>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>User Persona & Journey</h2>
                    <p>From the user research, I integrated feedback into user personas. For example, one of our
                        personas, Mandy is frustrated about her health management. She has attempted to create plans for
                        going to the gym and eating healthily, but she finds it challenging to take action or exercise
                        regularly.</p>

                        <source srcset="img/olive/persona-olive.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

                    </picture>
                    <p>I also created a user journey to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and expectations
                        that users may encounter throughout their experience. </p>

                    <h2>Skeches</h2>
                    <p>I sketched my ideas. Then I moves to mockups, and finally to the high-fidelity prototype. During
                        the sketch phase, I use Crazy 8 to explore diverse design ideas.</p>

                    <h2>Wireframes & Prototypes</h2>
                    <p>I then brought my idea to an interactive digital low-fidelity prototype and realised the need for
                        usability testing to iterate features.</p>

                    <h2>Usability Test</h2>
                    <p>I conducted user testing with six potential users. During engaging with potential users, I found
                        that I need to reassess users' challenges and explore a new solution. </p>

                    </picture>
                    <p>Insights: Users don't want to manage all aspects of their health. Recording all their unique
                        health details is not what they need. They are looking for something that can help them stay
                        motivated and improve their health with minimal effort.</p>

                    <p>I revisited users' feedback and created a new problem statement.</p>
                    <picture>
                        <source srcset="img/olive/problem statement-olive.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Major Design Iterations</h2>
                    <p>I made three major modifications based on the users' feedback and a new problem statement. I took
                        note of the user comments and suggestions and worked hard to implement them in order to solve
                        users' real problems. </p>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Iteration 1. Users want a simple and effortless health app</h3>
                        <picture>
                            <source srcset="img/olive/iteration1-olive.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
                            <img src="img/olive/iteration1-olive.png" alt="iteration1">
                        </picture>
                        <p>In the original design, users had to manually record their steps and calories burned.
                            However, users desire an app that simplifies the process of managing their health, making it
                            effortless. Consequently, I've developed an app that seamlessly assists users in their daily
                            health management with minimal effort.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Iteration 2. Don't make users more work</h3>
                        <picture>

                        </picture>
                        <p>Extra features can be confusing for users. Adhering to the Law of Simplicity, I simplified
                            the design and modified the recording process to allow users to easily record their workout
                            data with a single button click.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Iteration 3. The goal is not measurable</h3>
                        <picture>
                            <source srcset="img/olive/iteration 3.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

                        </picture>
                        <p>Many users liked the motivation feature (goals), but they couldn't measure their progress
                            toward these goals. Therefore, I replaced goals with level-based features, allowing users to
                            easily track their health improvement.</p>
