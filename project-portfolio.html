          <div>
            <p>
              While I was learning coding, I decided to create my own portfolio
              website. I want to make a website not only visually appealing but
              also increase my chances of getting an interview.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was challenging to create a website‚Äîfrom user research to
              actually coding the site. However, this was the most worthwhile
              project because I learned so many things, such as how a front-end
              developer works, how to analyse other websites using inspection
              and understanding what developers need from a designer when
              creating a product.
            </p>
            <p>
              I conducted user testing with 5 individuals relevant to the UX
              industry. As a result, they all found it easy to navigate and
              liked the incorporation of visual elements that reflected my
              personality. I am excited to test my portfolio while applying for
              jobs.

              You often see that almost 100 people apply for the same job on
              LinkedIn within one week. If we consider people applying from
              other platforms, how many individuals do you need to compete
              against?
              <br />
              <br />
              Applying for a job is not equivalent to securing one; it is one of

              whether it was possible to code certain elements. This experience
              deepened my understanding of Front-end developers' work and what
